This set is pretty great.</p><p>Sometimes you've been uninspired all month long, then you see ONE IMAGE, and it's like &ldquo;BOOM&rdquo;! Then that's it. You're off. You're ready to go. Your inspiration is carrying you through the design and everything is almost effortless. I kinda hate designs like that because they can only happen at the intersection of your availability to work on the design, your level of energy to focus on and create it, and then the inspiration striking you in just the right way. In some ways, it feels like cheating, with everything on auto-pilot; In other ways, it feels like a rare moment that must be seized at all costs, and held on to for a long as possible, and holding on to it takes every shred of you to push through to the very final step.</p><p>The image that fueled me with the inspiration me to create this design was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://o.ello.co/http://kiandjan.tumblr.com/post/161968229244/poemergent-60-x-120-kiandjan-2017\">poemergent · 60″ x 120″</a>&rdquo;, by a designer named <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkjtGWueANUf_XZxbT1a2Ng\" target=\"_blank\">@kiandjan</a>.</p>",

I've been very busy building my own infrastructure for a high quality, HD, fullscreen, perfect looping animation portfolio of all of my favorite designs. You can fullscreen it and study these animations at a much higher quality than what's allowed at any of the other places I've been posting them. Even I can get lost in my own work if I leave the full quality versions of these animations open too long.</p><p>It's really close to done, but not quite there yet. I'm still working out the bugs in the last details - I want this to be the best possible experience for perfect looping animation enthusiasts - and my perfectionism is close to being satisfied on this project. Look forward to it. ;)</p>",

That's pretty much what I can say about this design. It can often come from the very place that you intend to put your designs as well. I always look at the profiles of the people who reblog my work on a regular basis, and I have met some pretty cool people that way. In this circumstance, I found someone who has excellent taste in industrial design, and I was inspired by a LOT of what they have been reblogging. In an attempt to overcome my recent low of creative energy, I thought I would reach out to them and see if they would be interested in watching my process as I create something new. It has been an absolute treat making this design via screen sharing with <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/\">a friend that I met through her reblogs on my Tumblr</a>.</p><p>As it turns out, I work better when I get to interact with another participant when creating new designs. I used to mentor at a local community center for about 11 years - but it closed down last year because of political idiocy. This experience was doubly rewarding in that this friend was able to learn a great deal about the nuts and bolts of how to create a design in Blender. It was great for me, because it turns out that I have really missed teaching&hellip; so thank you, friend. :)</p><p>If you happen to be a fan of my work, have similar aesthetic tastes, and are interested in seeing how I create my designs, give me a poke. If you have 3 ~ 5 evenings to spare screen sharing, perhaps we can create something new together!</p><p>For anyone who digs on moodboards, here were the images which acted as our inspiration for this design:<br/>[<a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/142093238377\">00</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/148991132537/takeovertime-bathroom-furniture-swoon\">01</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/146997735492/henrycaird-alchemist-junghoon-lee\">02</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/146997716232/henrycaird-alchemist-junghoon-lee\">03</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/149081005417\">04</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/149012287622\">05</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/148305400227\">06</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/147096137732\">07</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/146960517722\">08</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/146574699982\">09</a>, <a href=\"http://artificialhousewife.tumblr.com/post/143144472367\" target=\"_blank\">10</a>]</p>",

I was like &ldquo;OH NO! MY OTHER PLANS FOR TONIGHT! THEY HAVE JUST DIED BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO MAKE A GIF!!!&rdquo; and then the modeling and animation for this design happened in about 3 hours. So I set it up to render at 3AM before going to bed. It was still rendering the next morning, so I went in to work, knowing that it would be done when I got home. Then I got home from work and realized that the output had flaws. So I was like &ldquo;NOOOOOOOO~!&rdquo;. Then I fixed those issues in about 2 hours and rendered it again last night starting at 1.75AM, and it finished this morning before I had to leave for work.</p>\n<p>I don't know who took that photograph, but I want to tell them: &ldquo;Thank you for violently attacking TWO NIGHTS worth of my evening plans. They DIED. BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL ART. But seriously. Your photography is Yes. How did you come up with the ideas for that lighting setup?

So I did. The first few revisions of this design looked nothing like this; In fact, they almost looked a lot more like one of my previous designs, <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/post/83790246330/cascading-tiles\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Cascading Tiles&rdquo;</a> - and I would almost have been happy with posting that&hellip; but I was having a hard enough time with the -execution- of the design that I was almost willing to give up on some of the creative aspects I wanted, and just post it so I could have something new up before the end of the month.</p><p>Then I showed the design to a few friends, and they said that it still needed some work. So I worked at it, and I recreated the piece from scratch with compound matrix transforms rather than with modifiers and face instancing. I spent a lot more time caring about what shapes were actually being tiled, rather than just using some boring, segmented and beveled planes. I payed a lot more attention to each of the specific details which I liked in the source image, and created a reference to each one in my design. Later, a happy accident with the hue slider in post-processing -really- brought the design to life with these wonderfully vibrant purples. All of the extra effort shows in this design, and I couldn't be happier with it. :)</p><p>The lesson I learned this time, is that sometimes it's a lot faster and easier to start over knowing what mistakes not to repeat, rather than to keep iterating on something which is difficult or inflexible to steer in the direction you -want- to be going.</p>",

Filmic expands Blender's dynamic range from 5 photographic stops to 25! SUCH BRIGHT DETAILS HOTNESS!</p><p>I don't normally think much about the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; for my designs - I have an idea for a subject, and that's what I create. The &ldquo;set&rdquo; of the scene is not something I am in the habit of thinking much about yet - but I think it payed off to spend more time on the scenery in this animation.

		"description": "<p>A few years ago, I had the idealized shape of a heart on my mind, so <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/tagged/i-heart-math\">I created a design set titled &ldquo;I Heart Math&rdquo;</a>. Last weekend, I started a new design set, in which I decided to revisit the shape and colors in the <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/tagged/i-heart-math\">&ldquo;I Heart Math&rdquo; set</a>, but use some of my newer production workflows to make like a zillion hearts - because I'm just feelin' that good these days. I thought I would also give myself a new conceptual guideline for this set: Allow the object instances to intersect with each other. Normally the thought of this is repulsive to me because I generally only consider my designs &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;valid&rdquo; when the objects -do not- intersect with each other. I'm happy that I tried this out though, because these designs are super beautiful. :)<br/></p><p>The objects in this set were animated using <a href=\"https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes/releases\">the Blender Animation Nodes addon</a>. I've really got to hand it to Jacques Lucke for his continuing work on the addon to improve performance, increase stability, add new features, and be so actively engaged with the community to both solve problems and provide amazing transparency into the development of a consistently amazing tool for other artists and developers. <a href=\"https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes/releases\">I'd like to congratulate him for making it to the 1.5 release</a> of what is currently my favorite part of my animation toolbox; It's been a lot of work getting it to this point, and that effort is incredibly appreciated! Thank you! :D</p><p>To anyone wondering - yes, the shader on these hearts is <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/manual/render/blender_render/materials/properties/subsurface_scattering.html\">SubSurfaceScatter </a>rather than Diffuse. Lessons learned: Path Tracing - 12 minutes per frame to get it looking good in the shadows; Branched Path Tracing - 3 minutes per frame. Branched Path Tracing will make your computer 100% unusable while it's rendering though - so plan to let that render sit overnight, or while you're away for a good chunk of hours. Also, if you're having issues with Blender crashing after only rendering a few frames of your animations, you should try using the <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_70_0/bpy.types.RenderSettings.html#bpy.types.RenderSettings.use_lock_interface\">&ldquo;Lock interface during rendering in favor of giving more memory to the renderer&rdquo;</a> lock icon in your Render Settings - it solved a crap-ton of problems for me. Thank you again for that tip, Jacques!</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>This design is number 4 of 4 in <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/tagged/hella-hearts\">a set titled &ldquo;Hella Hearts&rdquo;</a>, and uses assets originally created in <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/tagged/i-heart-math\" target=\"_blank\">a set titled &ldquo;I Heart Math&rdquo;</a>.</p>",

		"description": "<p>While I originally didn't think I had anything to say about this design, now that I sit down to post it, it feels more and more like a kind of progress and internal change marker for me. Seeing it completed, I'm realizing that it's motion is almost the exact inverse of the design I created named <a href=\"http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/post/92996732374/happy-tumblrversary-hexeosis\">&ldquo;Hexeosiversary&rdquo;</a> as tribute for <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mcMt6p3l_xzQ0Xm7X9YFLQg\">hexeosis</a>. The difference is that my whole design and production process has undergone 2 or 3 paradigm shifts since then. Things have also significantly changed in the ways I'm able to spend motivation on my art, and those are the areas which I will be focusing most on addressing next in my life.</p><p>Then: The production process used to be more labor intensive, but the inspiration and energy I had available was fresh and crisp, and even if the design was not perfectly clear in my mind, the inspiration lasted through posting. In the older design, I was getting frustrated and stuck with the mathematical imprecision I had with manually keyframing my animations, then restarting and retrying for about 3 hours until I got the animation right. I struggled with composition for some reason, and my usage of the material and lighting system was far from realistic. It used to be that my inspiration came from actually opening my production program of choice and just playing around with built-in functions until something aligned in such a way as to be interesting, and I worked with the design from there. I haven't been able to do that in a while though, but I want it back.</p><p>Now: The production process is a lot easier for me, but finding and keeping focus and inspiration to make it to the finish line are increasingly difficult. This time, I implemented the animation using the <a href=\"https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes\">Blender Animation Nodes addon</a> in about 1 hour, and I let my design inspiration guide me with the lighting and shaders, which took about 1 hour as well. I find that the more Math I put into practice through building custom shader node networks and animation node networks, the more natural and intuitive those things become to me. But this is where I hit my points of difficulty. Part way through the rendering process, I am held back my technical issues in the sotware tools that I use. They're typically tiny things that are simple to fix in production, but the fact that a render broke means that I have to go fix it, and that's not a super big problem&hellip; But wait, there's more broken, or the breakage stacks on top of some other bug in the software that's prevented me from completing other renders&hellip; and the motivation is just gone. So I have this amazing design that's stuck at 99% completion, but I don't have the motivation to deal with the crazy obscure problem that comes up in only this circumstance. These days, finding inspiration in someone else's work, or something else that I can already see, is the most essential part of my artistic and motivational processes. Without the inspiration, the work is simply drudgery and becomes completely impossible for me to complete. It is currently a hardship, but I will find my way back to a point where motivation is no longer a struggle. This is a promise which I make to myself, and all those who's lives I will positively effect through my work.</p><p>Anyway, this design was inspired strongly enough to make it to the finish line, and I have these two artists to thank for their works. My inspiration was a design by <a href=\"http://tmblr.co/m5wjwKL2NqvJ5FJ_n920Odw\">beeple</a> named <a href=\"http://beeple.tumblr.com/post/121070958584/testtube-enemies-fr\">&ldquo;TESTTUBE ENEMIES(FR)&rdquo;</a> and a design by my best friend, <a href=\"http://tmblr.co/msUme0P-DlLQZano7LOTlNQ\">obviologist</a><a href=\"https://ello.co/obviologist\"></a> named <a href=\"https://ello.co/obviologist/post/WJkCCF8Ykfso4eAKkEC1uA\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;ABC, easy as 123&rdquo;</a>.</p>",

If any of you happen to live in the valley, and have an interest in Motion Graphics, why don't you come downtown and meet me and some of these other interesting people on April 2nd?</p><p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/JMw0a8\" target=\"_blank\">A 1920x1080 wallpaper of this design is also available here.</a></p>",
